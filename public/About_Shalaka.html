<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there, its Shalaka Anand Parpattedar. I'm 18 and I live in Thane, Maharashtra located in India. I'm currently 
    pursuing my Bachelor's in Technology in Computer Engineering.
    I am really looking forward to learn multiple programmimg languages and fill my resume with various courses and skills. I 
    also look forward to participate in as many hackathons as possible so as to gain more experience and knowledge, meanwhile also 
    learning to work in a team with like minded individuals.

<p>This is one of my major projects, where I have put together my other mini projects completed in this ongoing course, to create 
    one Portfolio. So, that was a little about me, thanks for reading!</p>
